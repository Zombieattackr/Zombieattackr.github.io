Hello World! 
</head>
<body>
<p>IDK what exactly I'm gonna put here, CodeHS already works pretty well for my new tab site, so this will probably end up being a portfolio? Or maybe it can be both? 'Zombieattackr.github.io/newtab' ? </p>
<p>If you're reading this I assume I've applied for a position at your company and looking at the history of my portfolio, so hello! Pick me! Pick me! I don't know what this future position is that I'm applying for, but I'm sure I'm the perfect candidate!</p>
<p>Anyway, whoever you are, have a nice day!</p>
